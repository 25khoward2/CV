  <h3>Bio</h3>

  <p>School Life: During my school life, I get ready in the mornings, and then catch the bus. I sit in the commons during the mornings, and at lunch. I go through my 8 periods, and then go to RAP. I try to get most of my work done during school, but
    if I have homework, I go home and finish it. Sometimes, I must stay after school for certain projects. For example, my apron in sewing. Or I will go do homework with my friends at one of our houses. Then, I relax and then go to bed and repeat
    this all over again. </p>
  <p>Personal Life: A good example of my personal life would be during the weekends. I usually just watch Netflix or play video games on the Xbox or PS4. If I am not doing that, I am usually hanging out with my friends. That consists of going to
    their house or my house and watching a movie, playing video games, or going in our backyards to mess around. I have youth on Wednesday, and Boy Scouts on Mondays. Sometimes, my mom and my sisters will come over (seeing that I live with my
    grandpa) and we will spend time together doing random things. Sometimes, me and my mom go to the movie theatres to watch a new movie that comes out.</p>
